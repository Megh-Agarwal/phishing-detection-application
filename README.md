# Phishing probability estimation web application 

This application is a web application that estimates the probability that a URL is trying to phish. This application works on the basis of a ML model created and hosted
on the following API: https://phishing-model-api.herokuapp.com/predict

For indepth information regarding how the model is trained, with its internal, please refer the following [research paper](https://www.ijser.org/onlineResearchPaperViewer.aspx?Estimating_the_Phishing_Non_phishing_Probability_of_a_URL_using_a_Tree_based_Ensemble_Model.pdf).

This application is just an API, a web application is created for users to input their URLs following the showcase of the estimated probabilities. Please visit the following
